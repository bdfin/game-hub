# GameHub

This is a simple project that connects to the [RAWG video games API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) and displays sortable/filterable video game data.

I used this project to learn the basics of React.js and TypeScript.

This app is deployed via a GitHub action to an [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/app-service/static) and the demo is avilable [here](https://red-ground-00443e203.5.azurestaticapps.net/).
